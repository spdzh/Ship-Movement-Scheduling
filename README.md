# Ship-Movement-Scheduling

We are exploring the optimum scheduling scheme for vessel movement in Houston Ship Channel (HSC) in order to minimize the traffic delay in the channel. We considered 3 restrictions in this optimization model:
1.	Width restriction
2.	Daylight restriction
3.	Channel closure.

I used PuLP package in Python and applied genetic algorithm to find the best scheduling scheme with minimum delay.
